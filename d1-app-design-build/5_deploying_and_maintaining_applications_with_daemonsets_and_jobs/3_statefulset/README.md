# MySQL `StatefulSet` with `Headless` Service in Kubernetes

## Objectives

- Deploy a MySQL database cluster using `StatefulSet` in Kubernetes.
- Configure a headless service for `StatefulSet` pods.
- Use persistent storage for MySQL data with PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).
- Connect to the MySQL cluster from other pods in the same Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- A **GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)** cluster running and accessible.
- `kubectl` configured to communicate with the GKE cluster.
- A basic understanding of Kubernetes resources like `StatefulSet`, `Headless Service`, and Persistent Volumes.

## Step 1: Create a Headless Service

A **headless service** is used to allow direct access to the pods in the `StatefulSet`. This enables DNS resolution for each pod using their respective names.

### Create the Headless Service YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-db
  labels:
    app: mysql-db
spec:
  clusterIP: None  # This makes it a headless service
  selector:
    app: mysql-db
  ports:
    - port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
      name: mysql
```

### Apply the Service

```bash
kubectl apply -f mysql-db-service.yaml
```

## Step 2: Create a StatefulSet for MySQL

Now, we'll create a StatefulSet for MySQL. The StatefulSet will ensure each pod gets a unique persistent volume, and it will be able to scale with replica pods while maintaining the same storage across restarts.

### Create the StatefulSet YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mysql-db
  labels:
    app: mysql-db
spec:
  serviceName: mysql-db  # Points to the headless service
  replicas: 3  # Set the number of replicas (pods)
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql-db
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql-db
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        envFrom:
          - secretRef:
              name: mysql-db-password  # The secret containing MySQL password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
        volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: data
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 50Gi  # Size of the persistent volume
      storageClassName: standard-pd  # Optional: Define the storage class for GCP Persistent Disks
```

### Apply the StatefulSet

```bash
kubectl apply -f mysql-db-statefulset.yaml
```

### Explanation:

- **Service**: The headless service `mysql-db` will expose each of the StatefulSet pods via DNS. The `clusterIP: None` ensures no load balancing occurs, and instead, each pod gets a unique DNS entry.
  
- **StatefulSet**: 
  - The StatefulSet ensures each pod has its own unique persistent volume.
  - `replicas: 3` specifies the number of MySQL replicas in the cluster.
  - `volumeClaimTemplates`: This will create PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) for each pod to ensure that the data is persistent across pod restarts.
  - The `storageClassName` is set to `standard-pd`, which is used for provisioning Google Cloud Persistent Disks.

## Step 3: Create a Secret for MySQL Password

We will create a Kubernetes Secret to securely store the MySQL root password.

### Create the Secret YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-db-password
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: <base64-encoded-password>  # Replace with base64 encoded password
```

### Apply the Secret

```bash
kubectl apply -f mysql-db-secret.yaml
```

To encode your password in base64:

```bash
echo -n "yourpassword" | base64
```

Replace `<base64-encoded-password>` with the output of this command.

## Step 4: Verify the StatefulSet and Pods

Once youâ€™ve applied the StatefulSet and the Secret, you can check the status of your StatefulSet and ensure that the pods are running and connected to their persistent volumes.

### Check Pods

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You should see three pods created for the StatefulSet:

```
mysql-db-0    1/1     Running   0          30s
mysql-db-1    1/1     Running   0          30s
mysql-db-2    1/1     Running   0          30s
```

### Check Persistent Volumes

```bash
kubectl get pvc
```

You should see that the PVCs for each pod are bound to a PersistentVolume:

```
NAME            STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
data-mysql-db-0 Bound     pvc-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx           50Gi       RWO            standard-pd    10m
data-mysql-db-1 Bound     pvc-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx           50Gi       RWO            standard-pd    10m
data-mysql-db-2 Bound     pvc-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx           50Gi       RWO            standard-pd    10m
```

## Step 5: Access MySQL Pods

To connect to one of the MySQL pods, you can use the following `kubectl` command to exec into the pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it mysql-db-0 -- bash
```

Inside the pod, you can access MySQL by using the MySQL client:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Enter the password that you specified in the secret.

## Step 6: Connecting to MySQL from Other Pods

Other pods can connect to the MySQL cluster using the service DNS, which will resolve to the appropriate pod.

Example connection string for MySQL:

```bash
mysql -h mysql-db-0.mysql-db.default.svc.cluster.local -u root -p
```

Where:
- `mysql-db-0.mysql-db.default.svc.cluster.local` is the DNS name of the first MySQL pod.
- Replace `default` with the appropriate namespace if your MySQL cluster is not in the `default` namespace.

## Step 7: Clean Up

After the lab, you can delete the resources you created:

```bash
kubectl delete -f mysql-db-statefulset.yaml
kubectl delete -f mysql-db-service.yaml
kubectl delete -f mysql-db-secret.yaml
```

## Summary

In this guide, you have successfully:
- Deployed a MySQL cluster in Kubernetes using a StatefulSet and a headless service.
- Configured persistent storage using StatefulSet's volumeClaimTemplates.
- Accessed MySQL via DNS and connected to the database.
